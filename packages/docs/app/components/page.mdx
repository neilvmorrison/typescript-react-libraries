# UI Components

A collection of accessible and composable React UI components.

## Available Components

Coming soon! Component documentation will be added as components are added to the library.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @libraries/components
```

## Features

- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Accessible by default
- Tree-shakeable
- Minimal bundle size
- Dark mode support
- Composable and extensible

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Button } from '@libraries/components';

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => console.log('Clicked')}>
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Philosophy

Our components are built with:

- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliant with semantic HTML
- **Composition** - Flexible and composable APIs
- **Performance** - Optimized to eliminate unnecessary renders
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety with no `any` types
