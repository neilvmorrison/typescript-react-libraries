# React UI Components

A collection of minimally-styled and composable react components that meet WCAG AAA accessibility standards. These react components are broken into categories:

### Primitives

A collection of raw, minimally-styled HTML elements that have been wrapped in a `forwardRef` function to accept a ref and props. These components have no internal state or logic and are designed to be used as building blocks for other components.

### Components

A collection of React components that are built on top of the primitives. These components have minimal state and logic, but have a different interface to their HTML counterparts.

### Layouts

A collection of React components that are designed to layout other components.

### Data Display

A collection of React components that are designed to display data.

## Philosphy

The components are designed to minimize the amount of internal state and logic to keep the component as simple and easy to use as possible. Components are minimially styled and are designed to work with your existing styling system.

### Component Variants

Components, such as buttons, can have multiple variants, such as primary, secondary, danger, success, warning, etc. These variants are unstyled and appear visually identical to the default variant, but can easily be styled to fit your needs by following the styling guide below. You can also create your own variants by extending the component and overriding the default styles.

## How to install

You don't. Each of these components is a standalone file that you can copy and paste into your project. They will accept any styling system you have set up in your project.

## Features

The components are minimally-styled and designed to interact with your existing styling system. While you can use them as-is, they won't look very good. You'll want to override the default styles with your own custom styles.

### Zero External Dependencies

Each component is self-contained and does not rely on any external dependencies. This means you can use them in any react project without worrying about compatibility issues.

### WCAG AAA Accessibility Standards

Each component is designed to meet WCAG AAA accessibility standards. This means they are fully accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### Fully Customizable

Each component is fully customizable. You can change the color, size, shape, and more to fit your needs.

### Composability

Each component is designed to be composable. You can combine them with other components to create complex UIs.
