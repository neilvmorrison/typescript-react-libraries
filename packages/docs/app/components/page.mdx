# React UI Components

A collection of minimally-styled and composable react components that meet WCAG AAA accessibility standards.

## How to install

You don't. Each of these components is a standalone file that you can copy and paste into your project. They will accept any styling system you have set up in your project.

## Features

The components are minimally-styled and designed to interact with your existing styling system. While you can use them as-is, they won't look very good. You'll want to override the default styles with your own custom styles.

### Zero External Dependencies

Each component is self-contained and does not rely on any external dependencies. This means you can use them in any react project without worrying about compatibility issues.

### WCAG AAA Accessibility Standards

Each component is designed to meet WCAG AAA accessibility standards. This means they are fully accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### Fully Customizable

Each component is fully customizable. You can change the color, size, shape, and more to fit your needs.

### Composability

Each component is designed to be composable. You can combine them with other components to create complex UIs.
