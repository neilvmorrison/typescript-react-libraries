# Primitives

Raw HTML elements that have been wrapped in a `forwardRef` function to accept a ref and props. These components have no internal state or logic and are designed to be used as building blocks for other components. They maintain the same HTML semantics and accessibility as the original HTML element and default styles are removed using CSS modules.
