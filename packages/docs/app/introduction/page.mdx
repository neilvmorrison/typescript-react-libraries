# Introduction

Welcome to **@libraries** - a production-ready collection of React hooks, TypeScript utilities, and UI components.

## What is @libraries?

@libraries is a monorepo containing three carefully crafted packages designed to accelerate your React and TypeScript development:

1. **@libraries/hooks** - Essential React hooks for common use cases
2. **@libraries/utilities** - TypeScript utilities for data manipulation and API communication
3. **@libraries/components** - Accessible and composable React components

## Design Principles

Our libraries are built on core principles:

### 🎯 Production Ready

Every utility and hook is production-tested and follows best practices for performance and reliability.

### 📦 Tree-Shakeable

Import only what you need. All packages are built with ESM and support tree-shaking to minimize bundle size.

### 🔒 Type Safe

Full TypeScript support with no `any` types. Enjoy complete type safety across all packages.

### ♿ Accessible

Components follow WCAG guidelines and use semantic HTML for maximum accessibility.

### ⚡ Performant

Optimized hooks and utilities with zero unnecessary renders or re-computations.
