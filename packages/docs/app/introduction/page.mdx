# Introduction

Here is a collection of TypeScript utilities, React hooks, and UI primitives I've built over the years to [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) up my projects and minimize time-to-development.

## What is this?

**This is not a library**. You do not need to install it, nor will you be dependent on me for updates, support or bugfixes. You copy and paste the code into your project and use it as if you wrote it yourself. Each Hook, Utility and Component comes complete with documentation, tests and source code. You can choose to take all the parts you need or none of them. I can't tell you what to do, I'm not the cops.

## Why does this exist?

Every project has a startup cost. For me, that startup cost is usually what kills my ability to get a foothold on the project/problem before I am forced to move on to other things. Boiler plates are fine, but suffer from the a maintenence burden of keeping them up-to-date with the latest dependencies and features.

### Why not just get better at maintaining my own boilerplate projects?

I work across many different clients, each of which have their own application stack(s) and constraints. Atomized code snippets that can be easily pulled into are more useful than a monolithic boilerplate project.
